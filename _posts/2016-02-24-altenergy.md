Today at the ESRI Federal User Group Conference, they announced HIFLD Open, which is a subset of the HIFLD (formerly known as HSIP) data that is open, and with no release restrictions.  So we went looking for data that might be relevent for our environmental and energy analytics work.  Here's are some maps of alternative fueling stations across the country.  Each shows the distribution of seven types of fueling stations.  

From the [https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/]{HIFLD site}:
This dataset represents the locations of non-gasoline alternative fueling stations which provide biodiesel, CNG, electric, ethanol, hydrogen, LNG, and/or propane.

More than 250 million vehicles consume millions of barrels of petroleum every day in the United States. On-road passenger travel alone accounts for more than 2.5 trillion vehicle miles traveled

### Biodiesel
Produced from vegetable oil or animal fats, the projected production of biodiesel in the US is nearly 12 billion gallons.

### Compressed Natural Gas
If you've seen a municipal bus that's powered by natural gas, it's using compresed methane.  With the highest popularity in oil rich nations outside of the US, it's seeing limited use domestically.

### E85 (85% Ethanol gas)
<div class="flexItem col-md-4">
An ethanol fuel blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline.  Flex fuel vehicles can use E85.  Popular in corn growing states where there are local and Federal subsidies.

### Electric vehicle charging stations
<div class="flexItem col-md-4">
Heavy subsidies and the success of Tesla have increased the market viability and variety of all electric vehicles.  An increase in pay-as-you-go charging stations as show in this map make it feasible to travel for longer distances than previously possible.

### Hydrogen

A *hydrogen highway* is a chain of hydrogen-equipped filling stations and other infrastructure along a road or highway. Italy and Germany are collaborating to build a hydrogen highway between Mantua in northern Italy and Munich in southern Germany. *Source: Wikipedia*

### Liquified Natural Gas
<div class="flexItem col-md-4">
Liquified natural gas is primarily methane that has been converted to liquid for ease of storage or transport.
