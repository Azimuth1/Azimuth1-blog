Azimuth1 and dbS Productions produce the FIND software for managing search and rescue missions.  As an upgrade to the embedded TotalTopo map.  In a recent exercise in Idaho, we discovered that the forest service access roads in many regions are marked on the ground using number identifiers even when a road name exists. Remote forests in the US are often navigable only by a maze of numbered utility roads and our mapâ€™s users need more information to fill in these vast spaces. Open Street Map Data excels at providing excellent coverage in most places, but it falls a bit short on remote public land. So we've added the USFS road identifiers to <!--more--> our maps in a similar style as the official USFS maps. These identifiers provide further details that will help inform backcountry users and SAR teams.

Moving forward, additional 4x4 tracks, hiking trails, and other various wilderness points of interest will be evaluated and added from the USDA Forest Service data. These details will further assist our users in the identification of search targets as part of SAR investigations and users of TotalTopo. Additionally, labels will be refined to closely resemble Forest Service Topographic Mapping standards. User familiarity of symbols and patterns are key and can shave off a substantial amount of navigational time. We hope this speeds up rescue efforts.
