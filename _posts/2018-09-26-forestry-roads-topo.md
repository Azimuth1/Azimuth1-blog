As an upgrade to our existing TotalTopo map, users will now be able to utilize additional information inside our National Forests, namely Forest Service Roads. The data, as accessed from the USDA Forest Service, provides details that will help further inform backcountry users and SAR teams. Forest Service Route Annotation is now available as supplementary navigation and location information.  Remote forests in the US are often navigable only by a maze of numbered utility roads and our mapâ€™s users need more information to fill in these vast spaces. Open Street Map Data excels at providing excellent coverage in most places, but it falls a bit short on remote public land.

Moving forward, additional 4x4 tracks, hiking trails, and other various wilderness points of interest will be evaluated and added from the USDA Forest Service data. These details will further assist our users in the identification of search targets as part of SAR investigations and users of TotalTopo. Additionally, labels will be refined to closely resemble Forest Service Topographic Mapping standards. User familiarity of symbols and patterns are key and can shave off a substantial amount of navigational time. We hope this speeds up rescue efforts.
