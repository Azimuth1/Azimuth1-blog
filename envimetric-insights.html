              <p>EnviMetric is a method of creating a forecast for how widespread the contamination of
                soil and groundwater is after a leak or spill is discovered. When environmental scientists
                and engineers investigate these sites it requires many hours of analysis, days of field work
                on-site to collect hydrology, chemistry, and geology data from the site in order to create
                a good conceptual site model of the contamination.</p>

              <p>All
                of this is done without any new field work, instead leveraging what has already been learned about
                the target site, compared to the thousands of others in our collection.</p>

          <p>Far from being a 'black box', the EnviMetric model comes with a complete explaination of how the
            resulting model output was derived, a description of the data relationships that drive the model output,
            and statistical data that put the model in context with actual sites with simmilar geography, hydrology,
            chemistry, and geology.</p>
